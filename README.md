# tensor-handwritten-numbers
A project using docker + python's tensor library to train a NN to read handwritten numbers.

This project involved learning docker, python and its library system, and how to utilize the tensor data structure. This is my first venture into training, and has given me impetus to pursue my fascination with artificial intelligence.
